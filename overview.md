The “Freedom Project” for SEP10 is all about applying the content we are learning in our daily lessons to make our own creation.
The purpose of this blog is to help us learn more information about certain topics that we are intrest in.
For my project, I am making a website about Forensic science using Github, HTML, CSS, and tbd.
This blog will document the process of independently studying Forensic science and making the website.
